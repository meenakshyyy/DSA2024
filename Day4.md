## Statistics 
  * It is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.

## Descriptive statistics
  *  Use data to describe the properties of a population or sample.
  *  Descriptive statistics use indexes like the mean or standard deviation to summarize data.
  *  Examples of descriptive statistics include mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.

##  Inferential statistics
  * Use the properties of a sample or population to draw conclusions and test hypotheses. 
  * Inferential statistics use mathematical statistics and probability theory to analyze random phenomena.

## Mean: 
  * The average of a data set, calculated by adding all the numbers in the set and dividing by the total number of values. Also known as the arithmetic mean.
## Median: 
  * The middle value in a data set when the numbers are ordered from least to greatest.
  * 50th percentile.
## Mode: 
  * The number that appears most often in a data set.
## Percentile:
  * percentile is a term that describes how a score compares to other scores from the same set.
  * 25th and 75th are considered in some cases.

## Spread:
  * Describe how similar or varied the set of observed values are for a particular variable (data item).
  * Measures of spread include the range, quartiles and the interquartile range (IQR), variance and standard deviation.

## Standard deviation:
  * A standard deviation (or σ) is a measure of how dispersed the data is in relation to the mean.
  * Low, or small, standard deviation indicates data are clustered tightly around the mean.
  * High, or large, standard deviation indicates data are more spread out.

## Variance: 
   * A measurement value used to find how the data is spread concerning the mean or the average value of the data set.
   * It is used to find the distribution of data in the dataset and define how much the values differ from the mean.
   * The symbol used to define the variance is σ2.

## Interquartile range:
  * The formula for the interquartile range (IQR) in terms of percentiles is IQR = Q3 - Q1,
  *  Q1 is the 25th percentile
  *  Q2 is the 50th percentile, Median.
  *  Q3 is the 75th percentile.
  *  Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
  * Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR 
###  To calculate the IQR, you can:
  * Arrange the data points in order from lowest to highest
  * Find the median of the lower and upper half of the data
  * The median of the lower half is Q1, and the median of the upper half is Q3
  * Subtract Q1 from Q3 to find the IQR
  * Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
  * Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

## Outlier
  * An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations.
  * An outlier may be due to a variability in the measurement, it may be the result of experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set.
  * Any data point that's 1.5 points below the lower bound quartile or above the upper bound quartile is an outlier.

## Probability density function:
  * Probability density function (PDF) Describes the likelihood of a random variable taking on a specific value.
  * Cumulative distribution function (CDF) Describes the probability of a random variable being less than or equal to a specific value.

## Z score:
   * Z-score is a statistical measurement that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values.
   * Z-score is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean.

### Confidence Interval:
  * A confidence interval is the mean of your estimate plus and minus the variation in that estimate.
  * This is the range of values you expect your estimate to fall between if you redo your test, within a certain level of confidence.
  * Confidence, in statistics, is another way to describe probability.
