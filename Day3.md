## Evolution  of AI
* Perceptron vs neuron
* A perceptron is a single-layer neural network that uses a mathematical model to simulate a neuron.
  It has input signals with different weights, a processing function, and a threshold function.
  Perceptrons does certain computations to detect features or business intelligence in the input data.

## Correlation and causation
* Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two or more variables
   while causation means that one event is the result of another.

* Python and its libraries

* Supervised Learning: A system is trained on labeled data sets with known input and output variables.
* Unsupervised Learning: A machine learning type that looks for patterns in data without being given any labels.
* Reinforcement Learning: A model learns to behave in an environment by performing actions and analyzing the reactions.
