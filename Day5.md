## Probability distribution:
 * Mathematical function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of possible outcomes for an experiment.
## Normal distribution:
* A normal distribution or Gaussian distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable.
## Data Collection: Sampling
* Population: A Population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about.
* Sample: A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from.
* Sampling is a process in statistical analysis in which researchers take a predetermined number of observations from a larger population.
  It allows researchers to conduct studies about a large group by using a small portion of the population.
## Central limit theorem:

* The central limit theorem says that the sampling distribution of the mean will always be normally distributed, as long as the sample size is large enough.
   Regardless of whether the population has a normal, Poisson, binomial, or any other distribution, the sampling distribution of the mean will be normal.

## Significance Level(Î±):
*  Measure of the strength of the evidence that must be present in your sample before you will reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the effect is statistically significant.
* The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.

* For example, a significance level of 0.05 indicates a 5% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference.
* Lower significance levels indicate that you require stnger evidence before you will reject the null hypothesis.
* If the p-value is less than your significance level, you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the effect is statistically significant.
* In other words, the evidence in your sample is strong enough to be able to reject the null hypothesis at the population level.

### Null hypothesis:
* The statement that there is no effect or relationship between variables, or that there is no difference in the populations being tested. This is the hypothesis that is being tested to be rejected.
### Alternative hypothesis:
* The statement that there is an effect or relationship between variables, or that there is a difference in the populations being tested. This is the hypothesis that is being tried to be proven.

## Z test:
* A z-test is a statistical test to determine whether two population means are different or to compare one mean to a hypothesized value when the variances are known and the sample size is large.

## T test:
* A t-test may be used to evaluate whether a single group differs from a known value (a one-sample t-test), whether two groups differ from each other (an independent two-sample t-test), or whether there is a significant difference in paired measurements (a paired, or dependent samples t-test).
